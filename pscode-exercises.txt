// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

print Number
if Number divisible by 2 is true, then even
print even
if Number divisible by 2 is false, then odd 
print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

enter Num1 - Num5
Add Num1 + Num2 + Num3 + Num4 + Num5 = Num6 
Divide Num6 by 5
Print Average = Num7 
enter Num1 - Num5
Find minimum = Minimum
Print NumMin
enter Num1 - Num5 
Find maximum
Print NumMax = Maximum
